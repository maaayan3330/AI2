# As requested in Lecture 1, I would like to note that I used ChatGPT to learn some Python syntax I was unfamiliar with.
# Specifically, in the "is_wall" function, I used ChatGPT to help me understand how to structure the logical condition correctly.
# Other than that, all the thinking behind how to implement the idea and the cases I examined were challenging and based
