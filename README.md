A direct continuation of the KobanGan (Assignment 1) puzzle, this project extended the deterministic environment into a stochastic grid world. Implemented an intelligent controller based on Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and Value Iteration, using rewards and transition probabilities. Integrated the deterministic A* path as a guiding heuristic for optimal policy learning under uncertainty.
